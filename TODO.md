# TODO - JOUST.

## Objective

Create a 3D jousting game in the browser with pixelated visuals, side-scrolling mechanics, dynamic camera transitions, and a point-based scoring system using Three.js and WebGL.

## Week-by-Week Tasks

### Week 1 – Initial Setup and Visuals

- [x] Research pixelation shaders in Three.js
- [ ] Plan dynamic camera (side view to front cinematic view)
- [ ] Design low-poly arena and layout of spectators
- [x] Model base knight and horse in Blender

### Week 2 – Movement and Side View Mechanics

- [ ] Implement A/S key input for speed tapping
- [ ] Display MPH dynamically based on input
- [ ] Animate horse acceleration and movement
- [ ] Set up side-scrolling camera system

### Week 3 – Combat Targeting and Cinematics

- [ ] Build strike window with timed camera transition
- [ ] Enable mouse-controlled lance targeting
- [ ] Highlight body zones (head, chest, shoulders, arms) on hover
- [ ] Finish front-view combat perspective

### Week 4 – Physics, Reactions, and Lance States

- [ ] Integrate Cannon.js or Ammo.js for collisions
- [ ] Apply collision force and physics to knight and lance
- [ ] Create lance break states: tip, half, full
- [ ] Animate knight getting hit, staggering, falling

### Week 5 – UI, Scoring System, and Audio

- [ ] Create score tracker and bout system
- [ ] Implement lance icons that reflect bout outcome
- [ ] Add medieval background music and sound effects
- [ ] Build cinematic King reveal with flag announcement
- [ ] Add mute toggles for music and sound effects

### Week 6 – Final Polish and Deliverables

- [ ] Playtest full 4-bout loop
- [ ] Debug and optimize performance
- [ ] Finalize documentation and instructions
- [ ] Record and produce demo video
- [ ] Prepare codebase for submission

## Gameplay Features Checklist

### Core Mechanics

- [ ] Four interactive jousting bouts per match
- [ ] Speed buildup through alternating key taps
- [ ] Front-view lance aiming using mouse
- [ ] Scoring: 3 pts knock-off, 2 pts break, 1 pt hit, -1 pt miss

### Visuals and Animation

- [ ] Pixelation shader for retro aesthetic
- [ ] Animated spectators in red and blue
- [ ] Red/blue team color markers (bandanas and lance stripes)
- [ ] Dismount and collision animations

### UI and Feedback

- [ ] MPH meter display during movement
- [ ] On-screen scoring and bout tracker
- [ ] Lance icon visual feedback for break states
- [ ] Mouse-based highlighting of strike zones

### Audio

- [ ] Medieval looped music
- [ ] Horse gallop, lance break, and crowd reaction sounds
- [ ] Toggle for muting audio and music

## Future Expansions

- [ ] RPG progression with knight upgrades
- [ ] Tournament bracket with escalating opponents
- [ ] Unlockable armor and lance cosmetics
- [ ] Dialogue and story mode with rise-to-noble arc
